<p>To get my new website finally online, I want to add something to the blog section. Here in the future mostly stuff should be published that is related to archaeology and statistics using R.</p>

<p>To start I want to add a bit that helps to understand the relationship of several items within a collection of data. To be more specific, how can I explore the correlation of lets say pottery types or in this case animal species in the archaeological remains of different sites. Do specific combination occure regularily, so that it might be the case that they are functional related?</p>
