<p>Calibration of <sup>14</sup>C dates is one of the more common tasks an
archaeologists has to do. I will not go into the details of the details
why calibration is necessary here (maybe in another post), but I want to
give in this post and in some follow ups hands on instruction how a
calibration can be archieved using R. This series will be published also
at the <a href="https://www.github.com/ISAAKiel">ISAAKiel-Repository</a>.</p>
