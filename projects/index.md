## SPP 1400 "Early Monumentality and Social Differenciation"

Within this DFG project we investigate the first farmers of northern central Europe. 

Find more details on the [project website](http://www.monument.ufg.uni-kiel.de).

## RADON

RADON is one of the largest repositories for <sup>14</sup>C dates for prehistoric archaeology worldwide. We collect these data from the literature and from other available ressources to make them easily available for the scientific audience.

While [RADON](http://radon.ufg.uni-kiel.de) is dedicated to radiocarbon dates of the Neolithic, its new sister [RADON-B](http://radon.ufg.uni-kiel.de) collects dates of the Bronze Age.

I am responsible for the data aquisition for RADON and have developed and maintain the web application for both portals.

## Roxcal

To ease the analysis of <sup>14</sup>C dates I have developed and maintain a R package that serves as interface between R and the programme OxCal, that have established as quasi standard for calibration in archaeological application. The package is currently not available at CRAN, but you may find it at [Github](https://www.github.com/MartinHinz/roxcal).

## quantaar

Together with the team of the [Initiative for Statistical Analysis in Archaeology Kiel (ISAAK)](https://www.github.com/ISSAKiel) I am developing an R package that should make a collection of useful functions available for archaeologists. The package is currently not available at CRAN, but you may find it at [Github](https://www.github.com/ISSAKiel/quantaar).
