## SPP 1400 "Early Monumentality and Social Differenciation"

Within this DFG project we investigate the first farmers of northern central Europe. 

Find more details on the [project website](http://www.monument.ufg.uni-kiel.de).

## RADON

RADON is one of the largest repositories for <sup>14</sup>C dates for prehistoric archaeology worldwide. We collect these data from the literature and from other available ressources to make them easily available for the scientific audience.

While [RADON](http://radon.ufg.uni-kiel.de) is dedicated to radiocarbon dates of the Neolithic, its new sister [RADON-B](http://radon.ufg.uni-kiel.de) collects dates of the Bronze Age.

I am responsible for the data aquisition for RADON and have developed and maintain the web application for both portals.

## Roxcal

To ease the analysis of <sup>14</sup>C dates I have developed and maintain a R package that serves as interface between R and the programme OxCal, that have established as quasi standard for calibration in archaeological application. The package is currently not available at CRAN, but you may find it at [Github](https://www.github.com/MartinHinz/roxcal).

## quantaar

Together with the team of the [Initiative for Statistical Analysis in Archaeology Kiel (ISAAK)](https://www.github.com/ISSAKiel) I am developing an R package that should make a collection of useful functions available for archaeologists. The package is currently not available at CRAN, but you may find it at [Github](https://www.github.com/ISSAKiel/quantaar).

## Eythra

A web database for the Saxonian Archaeological Department.

## MetDB

The project 'Mobilities, entanglements and transformations in Neolithic societies on the Swiss Plateau (3900-3500 BC)' investigates the different phenomena of mobilities, social relationships and cultural entanglements as well as triggered cultural appropriations and transformations or rejections on the basis of ceramic and lithic material from a large number of dendrochronologically well dated swiss and Southern German wetland sites. To host the large amount of information regarding this material I set up a RoR based web application data base for the internal use in this project. More details on the project can be found at [its web presence] (http://www.iaw.unibe.ch/forschung/abt_pa_ufg/mobilities_entanglements_and_transformations/index_ger.html).
